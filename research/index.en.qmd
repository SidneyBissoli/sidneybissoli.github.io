**The notion of transference in "Studies on hysteria" (Breuer & Freud, 1895)**

*Paidéia (Ribeirão Preto)*

This article is part of a larger project examining how the concept of transference is dealt with in Freudian psychoanalysis. As the notion of transference appears for the first time in chapter 4 of "Studies on hysteria", this work acquires the status of the starting point for that examination. It verifies that the notion of transference cannot be understood as the whole relationship that a patient establishes with their psychoanalyst. It cannot either be understood as the total perturbation in this type of relationship, as it was later interpreted by other authors. It is only a very specific point of this relationship, in which, through a false bond, and in an uncommon way, the figure of the doctor replaces someone from the patient's past.
