## Who I am

I'm a psychologist with a master's degree, experienced in **public health research** and **financial markets analysis**. I use R programming to explore complex data and uncover insights that bridge psychology, health policy, and economic behavior.

My background in psychology, with emphasis on psychoanalysis, has given me a unique perspective on human decision-making — something I apply to both health data analysis and financial market studies.

## Areas of work

### Public Health
Analysis of population health patterns, epidemiological research, and health policy evaluation. I work with data from the Brazilian public health system (SUS) and other sources to understand trends and inform decisions.

### Financial Markets
Investment analysis, market behavior, and economic indicators. Special focus on Brazilian companies listed on B3, using balance sheet and financial statement data.

### Data Science
Statistical modeling, data visualization, and predictive analytics. I use the R tidyverse ecosystem to transform raw data into actionable insights.

## Technical skills

- **Programming:** R (tidyverse, ggplot2, tidymodels, Shiny)
- **Analysis:** Statistical modeling, data visualization, predictive analytics
- **Tools:** Quarto, Git/GitHub, RStudio
- **Data:** API extraction, web scraping, large dataset manipulation

## Outside of work

When I'm not analyzing data or studying markets, I enjoy reading about philosophy and history, watching documentaries, and spending time with family. I believe a balanced life contributes to more creative thinking and sharper analysis.
